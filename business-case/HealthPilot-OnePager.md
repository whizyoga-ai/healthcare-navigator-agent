# HealthPilot: AI-Powered Healthcare Navigation for Underserved Communities

## Problem

Over 30 million Americans struggle to access appropriate healthcare due to system complexity, language barriers, and limited health literacy. Navigating insurance networks, understanding coverage eligibility, finding in-network providers, and interpreting medical bills creates overwhelming friction—particularly for immigrant communities, non-English speakers, and low-income households. This results in **$264 billion annually** in avoidable emergency room visits, delayed care, and preventable complications.

## Market Opportunity

The U.S. healthcare navigation and patient engagement market exceeds **$8 billion annually**, with growing demand driven by value-based care mandates, health equity initiatives, and telehealth expansion. Over **100 million Americans** experience healthcare access barriers, while payers and health systems face mounting pressure to reduce preventable utilization and improve health outcomes. Medicare Advantage, Medicaid managed care, and community health organizations represent a **$15+ billion addressable market** seeking scalable, culturally competent navigation solutions.

## Solution

HealthPilot delivers **conversational, multilingual, AI-driven healthcare navigation** that guides patients through the entire care journey—from symptom assessment to provider matching, appointment scheduling, insurance verification, and post-visit follow-up.

Its multilingual, culturally adapted interface and transparent care guidance enable deeper engagement with traditionally underserved populations. Enterprise-grade HIPAA compliance, explainable AI decision-making, and social determinants of health screening differentiate it from generalized patient engagement tools.

Full compliance with **HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules**, **HITRUST CSF**, and **SOC 2 Type II** standards. Built-in bias monitoring, algorithmic fairness assessments, and clinical validation protocols ensure responsible AI deployment in healthcare settings.

## Funding Ask
